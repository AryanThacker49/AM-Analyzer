AM Analyzer 🔬Automated Material Analysis Platform for Additive Manufacturing📋 OverviewAM Analyzer is a modular desktop platform designed to standardize and automate the analysis of microscopy images for 3D-printed (Additive Manufacturing) metals.Traditionally, researchers spend hours manually cropping substrates, calibrating scale bars, and measuring porosity using generic tools like ImageJ. AM Analyzer replaces this manual workflow with a computer vision pipeline that processes images in seconds.This repository contains the Offline Edition of the platform, allowing researchers to run the full analysis suite locally on their machines.🚀 Key Features1. Automated Pre-ProcessingSmart Scale Detection: Uses OCR (Tesseract) and contour analysis to automatically find the scale bar, read the text (e.g., "200 µm"), and calibrate the image pixel-to-micron ratio.Intelligent Substrate Removal:Standard Mode: Detects the "jump" where the material meets the substrate using a bottom-up scan.EDM Cut Mode: Uses a center-out pixel scanning algorithm to trace cut surfaces.2. Advanced Analysis ToolsPorosity Quantification:Automated segmentation using CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) and Otsu's Binarization.Filters for pore size and sphericity to remove noise.Height-interval slicing (e.g., measure porosity every 1mm).Thickness Profiling: Measures the build height relative to the substrate across the entire width of the sample.Notch/Waisting Detection: Uses derivative analysis (1st, 2nd, and 3rd derivatives of the edge profile) to mathematically identify geometric inconsistencies and notches.3. Extensible Plugin Engine 🔌The "Custom Script" feature allows researchers to extend the platform without modifying the source code.Users can upload raw Python scripts (.py).The app automatically generates a GUI for the script (sliders, dropdowns, inputs) based on the code structure.Scripts receive pre-processed, calibrated image data instantly.🛠️ InstallationPrerequisitesPython 3.10+Tesseract OCR installed on your system.Windows: Download Installer (Add to PATH)Mac: brew install tesseractLinux: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocrSetupClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AM-Analyzer.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AM-Analyzer.git)
cd AM-Analyzer
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Key libraries include PySide6, opencv-python, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pytesseract.🖥️ UsageRun the offline controller to start the application:python main_alt.py
The WorkflowUpload: Drag and drop your .tif, .png, or .jpg microscopy images.Scale: The app will attempt to auto-detect the scale bar. You can verify it or draw a manual box to re-run OCR on a specific region.Substrate: Auto-detect the interface line. Use the "Manual Adjustment" tools to fine-tune endpoints if the sample is irregular.Contrast: Adjust the contrast slider to highlight pores against the metal matrix.Analysis Menu: Choose your tool:Porosity: Get % density, pore count, and shape factors.Thickness: View height maps.Notch Detection: Analyze edge consistency.Custom Script: Run your own Python logic.🧩 Writing Custom ScriptsAM Analyzer enables "Low-Code" tool creation. Create a python file that inherits from CustomScript:from custom_script_base import CustomScript
import cv2

class MyCustomTool(CustomScript):
    def setup_ui(self):
        # This automatically creates a Slider in the App UI
        self.add_slider("Blur Strength", 1, 20, 5)

    def run(self, image, metadata, params):
        # Your logic here
        val = params["Blur Strength"]
        blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (val, val), 0)
        
        # Return image to display and dict of results to export
        return blurred, {"Blur Used": val}
🏗️ ArchitectureFrontend: PySide6 (Qt for Python) with custom painted widgets for high-performance image interaction.Image Processing: OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy for vectorized matrix operations.Math: SciPy for signal processing (peak finding in notch detection).Graphs: Matplotlib backend embedded directly into Qt widgets.🔮 Future RoadmapCloud Integration: (Currently available in the Enterprise version) Syncing metadata and images to Google Firebase / Firestore.Foundation Models: Integrating Segment Anything Model (SAM) or YOLO for zero-shot defect detection without manual thresholding.API: Releasing a headless Python wrapper for batch-processing images on clusters.📜 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.Built by [Your Name] for the advancement of Additive Manufacturing research.
